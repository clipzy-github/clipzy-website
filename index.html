        Michael has taken down our clipzyapp.com domain. We are working with IONOS and ICANN to try to recover it. For reference, the ICANN case number is 01354693, and our initial contact at IONOS is Tiffany Masters.

                <p class="text-center">If you came from the viral TikTok post, as you may have expected, Clipzy died (but not for the reasons you may think). Clipzy's development was going well UNTIL one of the founders went rogue. They threatened to end the project, so in response, Lead Developer <a href="https://josemoranurena.tech" target="_blank">Jose Moran Urena</a> contacted Google to get access to the founder's account (since at the time, he owned the DBA, website, and $15,000 in credits from Microsoft and Google). He got mad and manipulated everyone to go against Jose and humiliated him TWICE over two Google Meets. 3 months after Clipzy's birth, it died. The founder is currently using some loyal developers to create something called Freelancing for All, which I highly recommend you do not use.</p>

                <p class="text-center">Due to all this, two contracts were signed between the parties involved. However, these agreements are voided as of 8/23/2024 as they were signed while underage and under duress, raising serious questions about their validity.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Asset Transfer and No-Contact Agreement:</strong> This contract, signed on April 2, 2024, forced Jose Moran Urena to transfer all assets, including Google Workspace and Github accounts, to Lumina. Both parties agreed to a strict no-contact provision. However, this agreement was made under duress and should be considered legally questionable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clarification of Ownership and Reassignment of Assets:</strong> Signed on April 3, 2024, this contract attempted to reassign ownership and revoke any claims made by Jose Moran Urena related to the Clipzy project. Additionally, it included a non-compete clause for 2 years and NDA. Again, the validity of this contract is void due to the circumstances under which it was signed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="text-center">Despite these events, we want to let you know that we're not done yet! Jose and BRuve (another GOOD developer) who got humiliated are now working on <a href="https://nerdyscriptz.nyc/" target="_blank">NerdyScriptz</a>, a new and exciting project. Additionally, if you need a reliable VPS, we highly recommend <a href="https://sentura.cloud/" target="_blank">Sentura Cloud</a> for your hosting needs. Finally, if you would like to see some incriminating evidence, check the <em>/exposion</em> directory and review the images named <em>image-x.png</em> (there are 18 of them). For example: <a href="exposion/image-1.png">https://clipzyapp.com/exposion/image-1.png</a>.</p>
